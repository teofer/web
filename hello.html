        <h1>The Clothing Company</h1>
        <h2>Figma for clothing design</h2>
            <h4>We solve two types of frictional problems that SMBs clothing companies face with their design push process:
            <ul>
                <li>Friction within SMBs clothing companies, throught the design process and its evolution </li>
                <li>Friction outside SMBs while dealing with manufacturing companies that explain manufacturing restrictions</li>
                
            </ul>
